# Launcher artwork

`ui/thanos.png` is the Thanos / Infinity Gauntlet image supplied by the repository owner for the launcher. It is copied unchanged from the supplied attachment; cropping and contrast overlays are applied only by the UI stylesheet. It replaces the generated island artwork in the home and Setup screens. No image-generation tool was used for this replacement.

## Season 4 redesign

The owner requested Season 4 images from the internet. These bundled images are loaded locally (the renderer does not contact image hosts):

## NOVA DROP identity

`ui/nova-drop.png` is the original NOVA DROP meteor emblem, generated with the built-in image-generation tool on November 1, 2026. The transparent PNG is used in the sidebar and startup screen. `scripts/create-icon.mjs` copies the unchanged image into the build resources; electron-builder converts it to the Windows icon. The previous `ui/logo.svg` is retained as an unused legacy asset. No Epic/Fortnite logo is reproduced in the NOVA DROP emblem.

Generation prompt:

> Use case: logo-brand. Create a polished original emblem for NOVA DROP, a private Fortnite Chapter 1 Season 4 (version 4.2) launcher. Asset type: square desktop app icon and launcher brand mark. A bold angular meteor descending diagonally from upper right to lower left, its sculpted comet trail forming a subtle N silhouette, with a small four-point cosmic spark carved into the meteor head. Fortnite Season 4 inspired stylized game art: confident chunky silhouette, crisp beveled facets, luminous icy cyan edges, vivid electric violet core, a restrained warm golden impact accent. Premium and energetic, readable at 32 pixels, balanced centered composition, ample clear margin around the complete emblem. Transparent background, real alpha, clean isolated shape, no square backdrop, no environment, no mockup, no text, no letters as text, no watermark, no official Epic or Fortnite logo. Make one finished logo emblem, not a sheet of variations. Broad solid shapes with controlled glow rather than thin fiddly lines.
